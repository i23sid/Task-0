INVENTORY PROPHET (Inventory Management System)

Inventory management remains a challenge for many small and medium businesses (SMBs), 
often leading to stockouts, excess inventory, and inefficient ordering processes. This report 
proposes Inventory Prophet, an AI-powered cloud-based solution that leverages machine 
learning for accurate demand forecasting and inventory optimization. We explore the 
problem of inefficient inventory management in SMBs and analyze how traditional methods 
fall short. The report details the functionalities of Inventory Prophet, including demand 
forecasting with machine learning models, inventory optimization algorithms, and 
automated reordering. We discuss the system architecture, including key algorithms, 
frameworks, and data sources. Furthermore, we outline the development team composition 
and cost considerations. A small-scale implementation using sample data demonstrates 
the core functionalities and presents a basic visualization of forecasted demand. Inventory 
Prophet has the potential to streamline inventory management for SMBs, improve 
operational efficiency, and boost profitability.
